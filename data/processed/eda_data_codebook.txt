THE CRSS DATA UNIVERSE
----------
The Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) is a sample of "police-reported
crashes" involving "all types of motor vehicles [and] pedestrians" (NHTSA, 2020).
The CRSS was created by the  Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
in order to equip researchers with the information they need in order to
"estimate the overall crash picture", "identify highway safety problem[s]",
and "form the basis for cost and benefit analyses of highway safety
initiatives and regulations" (NHTSA, 2020).

The CRSS data corresponding to the year 2018 was downloaded directly from the
official NHTSA website (in .csv format). The CRSS itself is a 'data universe',
with several different 'data items' that adopt different perspectives of the
events described in the CRSS. In this document, an overview of the final, cleaned
version of each relevant 'data item' is provided.
