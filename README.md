# nhtsa-crss-eda
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) I completed independently using R and the 2018 Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) data pulled from the NHTSA website.

This EDA was performed as my final project for the Data Science I (STAT 310-1) class for the Data Science minor during my time at Northwestern University.
